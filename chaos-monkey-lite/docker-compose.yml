  # Sample container, continuously sends ping to google.com.
  # The output prints ping delay in milliseconds, this makes it ideal for testing network delays.

  ping-google:
    image: "alpine"
    container_name: ping-google
    # IMPORTANT - all your containers should have this option enabled!
    cap_add:
